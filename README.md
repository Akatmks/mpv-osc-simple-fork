# Install

  1. Make a new folder in \~\~/scripts, such as ''\~\~/scripts/mpv-osc-simple''.

  2. Download all 4 lua files, and drop them in that new folder.

  3. Disable other osc scripts.

  4. Start mpv and enjoy.

# Other stuff

  1. ''cycle audio track'' button and ''cycle sub track'' button in the left bottom corner only shows up when more than one tracks are available.
  
  2. Click the play time will toggle skip file buttons.
  
  3. Click the duration time will cycle between duration and remaining time

  4. If anyone feels the osc too small, open ''main.lua'' with any text editor, locate then ''user options'' comment, and change *scale* below.
